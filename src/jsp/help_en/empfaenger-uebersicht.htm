   <div class="head1">Recipient - Overview</div>
   <p>For sending out newsletters, you need recipients' E-Mail addresses. In a newly created database (which will remain on the OpenEMM server) there is one record per recipient.
The default setting for the OpenEMM is that for each recipient, E-Mail address, first name, last name and greeting or title (Mr., Dr.,) are saved in the database. This is the required information for creating customised newsletters where subscribers are addressed personally. The database also saves which mailing lists a recipient has subscribed to. Several other fields are for internal use only, containing the required type of mailing (text, HTML etc.) and other management information. All data about a recipient constitute his or her profile.<br>
Management of all recipient profiles is done via the relevant sub-menu in the navigation bar and the edit-button at the end of the line. Please note that the OpenEMM has only one database for managing all your recipients. This means that it is very easy to send several different newsletters to one recipient.</p>
   <ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Deleting a recipient:</span> Sometimes recipients may request to be deleted from a mailing list. Please note that you do not have to delete a recipient to stop his newsletter subscription. All you need to do is to unselect the relevant mailing list (remove the tick). The recipient profile remains in the database. To delete a recipient from the database altogether, proceed as follows:
      <ul><li>Call up the list of recipients by clicking on the Recipients button, then on Overview. You may have to use the search function to find the recipient you want.
        <ul><li>Click on the Delete symbol in order to delete the subscriber from the list. The whole record is deleted from the database.
      </ul></li>
<p>You can Search for recipients by some criteria and for fields. You are also able to combine singular searchrules.</p>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Search for recipients:</span> The search function is called up by clicking on the Recipient button in the navigation bar. Your recipient list will soon be very long. As soon as you have several hundred profiles in your database, it will be rather awkward to find a particular profile in the list. For this purpose, the OpenEMM offers you an advanced search function which you can use to filter and list user profiles. Search requirements can be very different. This is why the OpenEMM offers several search methods: </li>
            <li>A field search will search for details in user profiles, for instance all users with the same last name, or all recipients with German shoe sizes between 40 and 43. </li>
            <li>There are three filters for recipients who subscribe to a specific mailing list, have a specific recipient type or a specific recipient status.</li>
            <li>Best of all: both search methods can be combined.</li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">Searching for fields:</span> The search screen above the recipient list allows you to filter recipients according to defined search criteria. You select the field and the relational operator in two drop-down lists. The next entry field takes the reference value. The three entries together form the search rule. Once you have defined a search rule, you can apply it by clicking on the Add button. The OpenEMM will display a new list containing only those recipients matching the search rule. You can easily identify user-defined fields by the name which you have selected for them. Fields for internal use have the following names (see list):</li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">BOUNCELOAD:</span>This counter measures how often a Soft Bounce has occurred. </li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">CREATION_DATE:</span>Date when the recipient was entered into the database. </li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">CUSTOMER_ID:</span>The OpenEMM will automatically assign a customer ID to all new recipients. This ID is unique. Each recipient can be identified unmistakeably by his or her customer_id.</li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">DATASOURCE_ID:</span>ID of the data source from where recipient data were imported. If csv data is imported, the OpenEMM will automatically assign an ID</li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">E-MAIL:</span> Recipient's E-Mail address</li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">FIRSTNAME:</span> Recipient's first name</li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">LASTNAME:</span> Recipient's last name</li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">GENDER:</span> Recipient's sex (gender). The OpenEMM uses numbers to identify a recipient's sex: 0 means male, 1 means female, and all recipients whose sex is unknown are marked 2. </li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">MAILTYPE:</span> Which mail type the recipient selected. 0 means text, 1 is HTML and 2 means offline HTML. </li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">ML.TIMESTAMP:</span> Date of last profile change </li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">TITLE:</span> Recipient's title (Dr. etc.)
          </ul></li>
          <p>Relational operators define a relation between the field content and the reference value. The OpenEMM supports the following relational operators:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">=:</span> Field value and contents are identical. The reference value may be a number or text. Please note: When using the "equals” operator, reference value and field contents must be absolutely identical. However, no difference is made between uppercase and lowercase letters: "Axel" equals "axel". </li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">&lt;&gt;:</span> Field contents and reference value are different (unequal). The reference value may be a number or text.</li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">&gt;:</span> The  field contents is more than the reference value. The reference value may be a number or text. If it is text, the sequence in the alphabet matters, i.e. "b" is more than "a".</li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">&lt;:</span> The field contents is less than the reference value. The reference value may be a number or text. If it is text, the sequence in the alphabet matters, i.e. "a" is less than "b".</li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">IS:</span>There are two special modifiers: NULL and NOT NULL. They are only relevant for very specific database operations. The database distinguishes between a text field which is totally empty and not used, and one which contains the "empty" string (character string of length 0, represented by ''). The operator NOT NULL will find all fields containing a character string, even if it is the "empty" string. The rule lastname = NULL will, for instance, filter only those recipients where a last name is missing. By contrast, lastname = '' will find recipients where the last name was originally there but was subsequently deleted or replaced by the "empty" string. This also works with numeric fields. If a field contains the digit 0, the database does not consider this to be an empty string. SCHUHGROESSE = 0 will find only those recipients where the shoe size field SHOE_SIZE in fact contains the entry 0. SHOE_SIZE = NULL, on the other hand, will find recipients who have never entered their shoe size in that particular field.</li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">LIKE:</span>  The field content is like a reference text containing wildcards. If you enter "%@t-online.de" as the reference value and select the LIKE operator, only recipients whose E-Mail address is with T-Online will be listed. Examples would be hans@t-online.de and maurer.krause@t-online.de. </li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">NOT LIKE:</span> The  field content is not like a reference text containing wildcards. If you select NOT LIKE, all recipients who do not have an E-Mail address with T-Online will be displayed. </li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">Combining search rules:</span> Many searches cannot be performed using just one search rule. The OpenEMM allows you to combine any number of search rules . Search rules are linked with the AND and OR operators. If, for instance, one of the additional fields defined in the recipient profile is "age" and you wanted to list all recipients aged 20 to 30 and having a GMX E-Mail address (@gmx.de, @gmx.net etc.), you would need to define three search rules:</li>
            <li>E-Mail  LIKE  %@gmx.% </li>
            <li>AND AGE_YEARS > 19 </li>
            <li>AND AGE_YEARS < 31 </li>
          </ul></li>
<p>The GMX search rule contains two % wildcards. GMX allows you to select your own country ID like .de or .net. The search rule filters all E-Mail addresses containing the character string @gmx.. To specify the search, proceed as follows:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>The first search rule checks the E-Mail address. In the Search for recipients drop-down list, select the E-Mail field. Select the LIKE operator. As a reference value, enter "%@gmx.%" into the field at the end of the line.</li>
         <li>By clicking on the Add button you can now apply the search rule. The OpenEMM will now display the E-Mail search rule above the drop-down lists with their entry fields.</li>
         <li>The search rule line now features an additional drop-down list. The selections AND and OR determine how the OpenEMM links the search rules.</li>
         <li>The second search rule checks whether the recipient is older than 19 (i.e., at least 20). In the first drop-down list, select AND.  As a field, select the user-defined age_in_years. Select the "greater than" relational operator (>).  The reference value is 19.</li>
         <li>By clicking on the Add button you can now apply the second search rule. The second search rule and the AND link now appear above the drop-down lists.</li>
         <li>The third search rule filters recipients whose age is less than 31 (i.e., no more than 30). Select the AND operator and the field age_years. Select the "less than" relational operator (<) and the reference value 31.</li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Searching for mailing lists:</span>  It is sometimes practical to display only those recipients who subscribe to a particular mailing list. Select the desired mailing list from the Mailing list drop-down list. The drop-down list displays all mailing lists which you have defined so far. Click on the OK button at the end of the line.</li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Search by recipient type:</span>Depending on which type the recipient is set up as, the subscribers are differentiated as Administrator, Test recipient and Normal recipient. This function is used for your personal control: you can check here who is authorised to receive which type of newsletter and if necessary make corrections to the recipient data. </li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Search by recipient status:</span> The OpenEMM also informs you about the current status of newsletter recipients.  The Recipient status drop-down list allows you to make the following checks:</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt"All:</span>The system displays all recipients listed in your database.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Active:</span>All subscribers who verifiably receive newsletters from you.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Bounced:</span>So-called bounces are server replies concerning failed newsletter deliveries. This may have various reasons: the address no longer exists, the subscriber mailbox is full etc. The bounce management of the OpenEMM enables these invalid subscriber addresses to be selected and excluded from further mailings. This not only means a financial saving, but also ultimately increases the effectiveness of your newsletter mailing.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Opt Out by Admin: </span> All subscribers who have been excluded with an opt-out marker from the mailing by one of the administrators are listed here. These are subscribers who are no longer sent newsletters, although they have not been deleted from the database.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Opt Out by subscriber:</span> All subscribers who have opted out themselves by unsubscribing. These are subscribers who are no longer sent newsletters, although they have not been deleted from the database.</li>
      </ul></li>
