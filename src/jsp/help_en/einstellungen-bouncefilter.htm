   <div class="head1">Settings - Bounce-Filter</div>
   <p>Bounce-filters define actions, which are executed after receiving a reply E-Mail from a recipient. When receiving a reply, first all autogenerated replies are removed for your convenience. On the remaining E-Mails the actions of the bounce-filters are applied. Possible actions are forwarding and autoresponse.<br>
   Create new bounce-filter:<br>
   Click on "Settings" on the left part of OpenEMM. In the submenu select "Bounce-Filters". On the right side the existing bounce-filters are shown. Click on "New Bounce-Filter" above the list.<br>
   Choose the bounce-filter you want to edit by clicking on the name. The input dialog with the current properties of the bounce-filter is shown.</p>
   <ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Name:</span> The field "Name" is shown in the list of bounce-filters.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Description:</span> Enter some descriptive text in this field</li>
   </ul>
   <p>To finish your entries click Save. After that you will be forwarded to the bounce-filter overview page. Now appears an E-Mail address in form of xxx@filter.yourcompany.com in the overview. All E-Mails, that are sent to this E-Mail address will be processed according to the actions defined by the bounce filter. Therefore one last step is necessary to finish the setup of the bounce filter.<br>
   All reply mails of a mailing will be sent to the sender's address resp. the reply-to address (if defined) of the mailing (for example newsletter@company.com). Now set up in your E-Mail client of that address a forwarder to the E-Mail address stated in the overview (xxx@filter.yourcompany.com). Only if this forwarder has been set up, the bounce management can filter all automatically  generated replies and forward the remaining E-Mails according to the settings of the bounce-filter and/or reply them via an autoresponder.</p>
