   <div class="head1">Statistic - IP statistic</div>
   <p>The purpose of IP statistics is to determine which IP addresses recipients used to subscribe to a mailing list. OpenEMM shows the 20 top-ranking IP addresses. This statistical feature is meant to prevent fraud. There are lottery agencies who will register their paying members with all lotteries, raffles and promotions they can find. Since the members are not really interested in the promotion in question, such E-Mail data is worthless.<br>
Some agencies even use fraudulent E-Mail addresses; mails sent to such addresses will never be read.  It is relatively easy to create an E-Mail domain so that the E-Mail address itself is no indicator for a scam.  However, the agency usually has an IP address. If this IP address suddenly appears in the top 20 statistics, this could indicate fraud. You also may export this statistic by clicking on the export-button. You will get a csv-file to save on your computer.</p>

   <p>The IP address shows the recipient's IP address.  In the Recipients column, the system lists how many subscribers used that address to register.  Various drop-down lists can be used to narrow down the statistical base:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Targetgroup</span>The Target drop-down list selects members of your target group. </li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Mailinglist</span> The Mailing list drop-down list selects only subscribers of a particular mailing list for statistical evaluation. Both selection criteria can be combined. </li>
<p>To finish, OpenEMM will recalculate all statistical data after clicking on the OK button.</p>
   </ul>
