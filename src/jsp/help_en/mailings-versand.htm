	<div class="head1">Mailings - Delivery</div>
	<p>Your mailing is now ready, the contents have been incorporated and the test mails have been reviewed several times. You are now ready to send your mailing!</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Click on the Send mailing sub-menu on the Send mailing screen. The OpenEMM will allow you to view the planned mailing. The Recipients selection area shows all recipients you have defined as a target group prior to sending the mailing for you to check your selection again. The system also displays the number of recipients as well as the selected mail formats.</li>
		<li>In the Delivery time area, several drop-down lists allow you to select precisely when sending out the mailing should start. You could select automatic sending at 12 midnight, and the OpenEMM will then comply with your wishes.</li>
		<li>Now click on the Send button. This starts the mailing. Should you wish to make further changes, click on Cancel instead.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>After sending, the Send mailing view will display a status report.  You must, however, single-click on the Send mailing tab to generate the status report which will then be displayed.<br>
	   You can still call up the preview and send the mailing to administrators and the test distribution list. The Send mailing now selection is unavailable. In this way, sending out a mailing more than once by mistake will be prevented. The Distribution status report in the lower part of the screen now displays how many recipients the mailing has already been sent to. Each time you click on the Send mailing tab again, the status report is updated.  Automatic updates are not provided.</p>
