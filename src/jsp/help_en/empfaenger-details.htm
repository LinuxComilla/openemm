   <p>The database contains specific data on each recipient , i.e. his or her profile. You can call up individual recipient data by clicking on the Edit icon or on the relevant E-Mail address. This calls up an entry dialog with the data saved for that particular recipient, under the Recipients tab in the contents area. Data from the profile are organised in three distinct areas. At the top you will find general information, followed by additional profile data and available mailing lists. The marked mailing lists are subscribed by the recipient. By clicking the cancel-button you return to the overview without any changes.</p>
