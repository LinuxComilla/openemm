   <div class="head1">Recipient - Export</div>
   <p>The navigation bar offers an Export function which is accessed by the Recipients tab. The Interface is separated in three areas. In the first area you choose which recipient will be exported. You may differentiate between mailing list, recipient type, recipient status and targetgroup. You may use all criteria at the same time, OpenEMM exports all recipients, who meet the criteria.</p>
   <ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Mailing list:</span> All mailing lists which you have created will be displayed.  You can export the particular list by clicking on the corresponding check box.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Recipient type:</span> Only the recipient from the chosen types in the mailing list will be exported. You can choose between the following recipient types:
      <ul>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">All:</span> Without any limitation </li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Normal recipient:</span> All recipients who should receive a newsletter or specified mailing are named as normal recipients. </li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Administrator:</span> A person who has to check all mailings before they get delivered is called Administrator. Only Administrators will be exported by selecting this type.</li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Test recipient::</span> If you want to test your mailings before deliver, its inevitable to send sample E-Mails to test recipients from the mailing list. These recipients will be exported by selecting this type. </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Recipient status:</span>Only the recipients in the mailing list with the selected status will be exported. There are five settings available:
      <ul>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">All:</span> Without any limitation</li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Active:</span> The recipient subscribed to the specified mailing list. You can see under 'note' why the recipient got this status.</li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Bounced:</span> The address is invalid, in vacation-mode or the recipient signed off. </li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Opt-Out by admin:</span>An Admin unsubscribed the recipient </li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Opt-Out by recipient:</span>The recipient unsubscribed himself </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Target group:</span> Only the recipients will be exported, who are set in the specified target group.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The second area specifies the fields which will be exported with every single recipient. By marking the particular fields every field will create his own column in the final csv-file. You can also choose if you want to see, if the recipients have subscribed/unsubscribed any listed mailing list.<br>
The third area specifies the export file-format. You will always get a textfile, which will be changed in a regular excel format by importing the CSV-file in excel. The unique dropdown menus have the following meaning </p>
   <ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Separator:</span> If you store recipient data in a spreadsheet software such as Excel and save them in a CSV file, data is usually separated by a semicolon. Other programs may use different separators. You can, however, specify a different separator in the drop-down list.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Text recognition character: </span>In case your recipient data contain the separator specified, it must be identified by a different character. If the separator, for instance, is a comma, and if recipient data also contain commas, the commas used as separators must be identified separately before import.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Character set:</span>The default value is the Western European character set ISO 8859-1, which you might as well use. You should only select a different character set if your CSV file also uses that character set. </li>
   </ul>
