	<div class="head1">Mailings - File attachments</div>
	<p>The optional file attachment function can increase your OpenEMM's usefulness for mailings quite considerably. It allows you to provide recipients with further information over and above the newsletter text. You could, for instance, send out vouchers or price lists by way of a file attachment.<br>
	   OpenEMM also makes sure that file attachments are free of viruses and worms and that they are not corrupt or dangerous.  Each time a file is uploaded to the OpenEMM server it is first scanned by an antivirus software.  The OpenEMM will only accept files if they have been scanned and are virus-free.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>In order to append a file to your mailing, you must start by selecting the mailing. Click on the Mailings button in the navigation bar and click on the required mailing in the overview. In the mailing details, open the Attachments tab.</li>
		<li>In the entry dialog, enter file name and directory of the required file attachment into the Attachment input field. It is usually easiest to use the Browse button to call up the Windows file selection dialog. Select the file you want to send and click on Open. The browser inserts the complete file directory into the field.</li>
		<li>The entry field Attachment name is used to define a name for your file attachment. In our example, the original name <I>news.pdf</I> will be used.</li>
		<li>The Target drop-down list is used to set which recipients are to receive the attachment. Since you may define any number of attachments for each mailing, you can easily specify different attachments for different target groups.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>By clicking on Add, the selected file is appended to your mailing. Underneath the entry dialog, the OpenEMM now shows a list with all defined file attachments. The attachment list shows several details and interfaceabilities for every entry. If you want to delete an attachment, click on the delete-button, but note, the attachment will be deleted without any further query.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The MIME type (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) tells you what sort of attachment you have selected. When sending out a mailing with a text attachment, this will be characterised as text/plain. Our example uses a pdf file as an attachment, so the MIME type is application/pdf. Any HTML elements included will also be shown here.<br>
		    There is also a difference between the Original size and the Size in E-Mail. The reason is that the software converts the file attachment into a sendable format (ASCII-Format) which is about 30 to 40 per cent larger than the original format. The recipients E-Mail-Client will change the attachment to the original format.</li>
		<li>Again, you have the option of defining a Target group for this attachment. If you are sending out several attachments, this does make it easier to assign an attachment to a different group later. In our example, you leave the original settings. You must, however, remember to tell the system to Save any such changes.</li>
		<li>As soon as all data have been entered to your satisfaction, click on Save to tell the system to store your data. If you want to delete the attachment again from the mailing, just click on the Delete button.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>To define further file attachments, call up the entry dialog again and click on the Add button.</p>
