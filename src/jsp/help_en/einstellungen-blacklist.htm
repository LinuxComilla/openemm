   <div class="head1">Settings - Blacklist</div>
   <p>It may happen that a recipient contacts you who would not only like to be deleted from the list, but also threatens legal action if he continues to receive mailings from you. In such cases the blacklist is a safe means of completely excluding individual subscribers from further mailings and protecting you from any trouble. E-Mail addresses that have been entered in the blacklist are automatically excluded from future mailings of your newsletters, even if unknown third parties should register these subscribers again.</p>
   <ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Adding:</span>In order to place an address on this list, click on the Settings tab. Enter the relevant address in the entry field which opens in the contents area. Clicking on Add stores that address in the blacklist. </li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Deleting:</span>If an address has been mistakenly included in the blacklist, the entry can be easily corrected by clicking on the Delete symbol behind that address.</li>
   </ul>   
   <p>Please note:<br> The system does not require confirmation but deletes the address immediately.</p>
