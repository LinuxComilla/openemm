   <div class="head1">Create new type of salutation</div>
   <p>You choose whether to greet your customers more formally or whether you prefer a more relaxed style of address. The OpenEMM allows you to save your chosen form of address and to use it with your next mailing to greet customers. The system distinguishes between male and female recipients as well as those whose sex is unknown.<br>
   Click on the Settings tab in the navigation bar, then on the Forms of address submenu. A list of defined forms of address is displayed. To create a new entry, click on the New form of address tab. The OpenEMM opens an entry dialog with several input fields. </p>
   <ul>
      <li>In the Description field, enter a meaningful name.</li>
      <li>Enter your selected greetings into the fields under Salutation. The profile database stores each recipient together with his or her sex (gender field). Male recipients are assigned 0, female recipients have a gender of 1. Any recipients whose sex is unknown are assigned a gender of 2. There is one field per gender. When sending out the mailing, each E-Mail is completed by a greeting, a title (if applicable) as well as the last name.</li>
      <li>Once you have entered your texts, click on the Save button. The new entry is now displayed in the Forms of salutation overview. The first column contains the ID for this form of address. The OpenEMM assigns this ID automatically.  </li>
      <p>The ID is used to select a form of address and to include this address in the mailing by using the AGNITAS-TAG [agnTITLE type=xx]. In place of xx you put in the ID of the particular address.</p>
   </ul>
