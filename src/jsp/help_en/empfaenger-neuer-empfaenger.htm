   <div class="head1">Recipient - New recipient</div>
   <p>The OpenEMM system allows creation of individual recipients. This only makes sense if you want to create a few new recipients. In most cases, importing existing data or having users register themselves via the web interface will be more practical.
Click on Recipients, then New recipient in the navigation bar. An entry dialog opens in the contents area for you to enter data for the new subscriber. This looks like the screen for new recipients and is divided in two sections. New recipient data should be filled in the fields in the upper area. In the following area you enter the mailinglist which the recipient should subscribe. Please note: you must enter a unique E-Mail address for the new recipient. The salutation drop-down list only sets the recipient's sex. The actual form of address is defined elsewhere. Leave the mail format as HTML (default) unless you want another format.</p>
        <ul>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Salutation:</span> Sets the recipients gender. The exact salutation can be changed in the mailings.</li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">TITLE:</span>title of the recipient (Dr etc.)</li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">FIRSTNAME:</span> firstname of the recipient </li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">LASTNAME:</span> lastname of the recipient </li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">E-Mail:</span> Shows the E-Mail address of the recipient</li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Mail format:</span></li>
         <ul>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">Text:</span> In Text format, all E-Mail-clients are able to open this mailing, but format instructions (bold, hyperlinks, fontsize ...) will not be included.</li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">HTML:</span> In HTML format, images and specific formatting may be added to the mailing. By using images from external AGNITAS-servers, your client may get problems with some browser interfaces using for example a GMX-mail account. </li>
            <li><span class="menuepunkt">Offline-HTML:</span> In Offline-HTML format, images are actually integrated into the E-Mail as a attachment, while in the normal HTML version images are downloaded from the server once the E-Mail is opened. </li>
         </ul></li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">More profile data:</span> The Other profile data section contains fields for internal use as well as all user-defined fields for the recipients' profiles. Fields for internal use are: </li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">timestamp:</span> Date of last profile change</li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">creation_date:</span> Date of recipient profile creation</li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">datasource_id:</span> where the data were imported from User-defined fields follow. This list can be of any length and is based solely on your needs and requirement criteria, for instance customer IDs or other reference numbers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The sub-menu Mailing Lists contains all mailing lists created so far. The OpenEMM system shows which lists your recipient has subscribed to by ticking them. If the recipient has subscribed to a particular mailing list, the OpenEMM shows additional data. </p>
        <ul>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">E-Mail:</span> if this option is marked, the recipient has subscribed the mailing list. To subscribe a mailinglist, click on the set box of the particular mailinglist.<br>
         Type:
         <ul>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Normal recipient:</span> All recipients who have subscribed to a newsletter and want to receive it are normal recipients. </li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Administrator:</span> Normal recipient: All recipients who have subscribed to a newsletter and want to receive it are normal recipients.
Administrator: The creator of a mailing is the administrator. You should create a recipient profile for yourself (if you have not already done so) and assign yourself the status of Administrator for that mailing list.</li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Test recipients:</span> To test the mailing, it is essential to send a few test mails to test recipients. They are not real recipients but E-Mail addresses only you have access to. You could also assign that status to someone who has to check a mailing prior to sending it to all recipients on the list.</li></ul></li>
        </ul>
