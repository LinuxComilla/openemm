	<div class="head1">Mailings - Send mailing</div>
	<p>If the preview was conducted to your satisfaction, you can send your mailing to a few selected test recipients. They could be your administrator(s) or a test distribution list. This test distribution list should only contain the E-Mail addresses of selected persons who can give you feedback about the appearance of the E-Mails.</p> 
        <ul>
        	<li><span class="menuepunkt">Test mails to administrators:</span> Single-click with the mouse on Send test mails to administrators. All recipients who are marked as Administrator in their profile and who have subscribed to the mailing list will be sent a test mail.</li>
        	<li><span class="menuepunkt">Test mails to test distribution list:</span> Single-click with the mouse on Send test mails to the test recipients. All recipients who are marked as Test recipient or Administrator in their profile and who have subscribed to the mailing list will be sent a test mail. You or your comrade may receive this testmailing and can find errors or any problems.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Check the test E-Mails sent very carefully! Flawed E-Mails sent to hundreds thousands of customers are simply embarrassing. If you do find any errors, modify the contents accordingly and start the test run over again.<br>
           The Distribution status area gives you further information on how many mails have been generated. By clicking on send mailing, the specified mailing will be send to all recipients who subscribed the defined mailinglist.</p>
