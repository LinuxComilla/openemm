	<div class="head1">Campaign - Details</div>
	<p>Campaigns help you to structure your mailings if there are a lot of them. In a campaign, you group all mailings relating to the same subject in a file. A campaign may, for instance, consist of all mailings sent over several weeks to customers in the context of a promotion campaign.  The campaign may group date or action-based mailings or all mailings sent out in the context of a weekly newsletter feature.</p>
	<p>You decide how to group mailings into campaigns. Whenever you create a new mailing, you decide which campaign it should belong to. It is, of course, still possible to create mailings without assigning them to a campaign, or to decide which existing mailing should be grouped together. Campaign assignments may be amended at any time.</p>
	<p>There are no rules in OpenEMM on how to assign mailings to campaigns. It is possible to create a campaign called "Miscellaneous" grouping single mailings for which there is no special category. The list of mailings in the Mailings section will not change by campaign assignments and will still show all mailings created so far and sorted by date.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">Name:</span> In the Name field you can enter a short campaign description, e.g. Newsletter.</li>
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">Description:</span> The Description should consist of one or two sentences characterising your new campaign. This will make mailing management easier once you have many campaigns which are used by several staff.</li>
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">Mailings:</span> To create a new campaign, go to the Campaigns section in the navigation bar. Open the Campaigns section and click on the sub-menu New campaign. You can enter in the displayed fields the name of the mailing, the subject, the targetgroup, the sender address, the template, mailinglist and type.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You can edit the campaign by clicking on the edit-button (<img src="icon-bearbeiten.gif" alt="edit button" border="0">). To delete an existing campaign, click on the delete-button (<img src="icon-delete.gif" alt="delete button" border="0">). You can even create a new mailing out of the campaignmenu by clicking on "new mailing" under the mailings-field. This will automatically assign the mailing to this campaign.</p>
