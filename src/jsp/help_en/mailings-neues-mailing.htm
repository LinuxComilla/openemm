	<div class="head1">Mailings - New Mailing</div>
	<p>In this section you may create a new mailing. You need an existing mailing list to create any mailing. By clicking on the save-button you have created the new mailing. The delete-button resets all entries or deletes the mailing. The field have the following meaning: </p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">Name:</span> The name of the Mailing you choose at its creation.</li>
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">Description:</span> You can use the Description field to add further information, helping you to distinguish your mailing according to internal procedures</li>
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">Mailing list:</span> A Mailing list has to be created already. You will start by determining which Mailing list your mailing should be based on. In other words, you will select the recipients who feature that particular mailing list in their profile.</li>   
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">Campaign:</span> By selecting a Campaign, you assign the mailing to a specific campaign. This makes mailing updates easier if you have to manage a large number of mailings. Moreover, it gives you another option for statistical evaluation.  All previously defined campaigns are displayed in that drop-down list. You do not have to assign the mailing to a campaign. The mailing will also work as a stand-alone action.  You can always select a campaign or change the campaign assignment for your mailing later.</li>
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">Type:</span> In the drop-down list Mailing type, select Normal mailing. This creates a simple newsletter. You can also create an action based or databased mail.</li>
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">Template:</span> It is possible to assign a user-defined template to the mailing using a drop-down list.</li>  
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">Target Group</span>
		<ul>
			<li>The Target groups functional area contains various options for narrowing down your list of mailing recipients further.  In order to be able to work with target groups, you have to define your target groups. If you would like to send the mailing to more than one target group, select the required target groups from the drop-down list and click on Add. If more than two individual target groups are involved, the user may select whether all recipients must be found in ANY one of the target groups (logical operator OR) or in ALL target groups (logical operator AND). If you want to delete individual linked target groups from the list, just click on the delete-button.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">E-Mail section:</span>
		<ul>
			<li><span class="menuepunkt">Subject:</span> Enter text which will appear as the subject heading of the mailing in the recipient's E-Mail client.</li>
			<li><span class="menuepunkt">The Sender E-Mail</span> is the address shown as sender of the E-Mail.  You should therefore use a meaningful address, such as newsroom@yourcompany.com, which does in fact exist.</li>
			<li><span class="menuepunkt">The Reply-To E-Mail</span> is the E-Mail address for replies. It is possible to assign different names to the Sender Full Name and the Reply-To Full Name.  If you enter only one name, e.g. into the Sender Full Name field, it will be used as the Reply-To Full Name.</li>
			<li><span class="menuepunkt">Format:</span> Hier k&ouml;nnen Sie den Versand an Empf&auml;nger eines bestimmten Mail-Formats ausw&auml;hlen:
			<ul>
				<li>In <span class="menuepunkt">Text</span> format, all E-Mail-clients are able to open this mailing, but format instructions (bold, hyperlinks, fontsize ...) will not be included.</li>
				<li>In <span class="menuepunkt">HTML</span> format, images and specific formatting may be added to the mailing. By using images from external AGNITAS-servers, your client may get problems with some browser interfaces using for example a GMX-mail account.</li>
				<li>In <span class="menuepunkt">Offline-HTML</span> format, images are actually integrated into the E-Mail as a attachment, while in the normal HTML version images are downloaded from the server once the E-Mail is opened.</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">Character set:</span> The default value is the Western European character set ISO 8859-1, which you might as well use.</li>  
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">Line feed after:</span> This box is used for defining the line breaks for the text version of your mailings. By default, a break after 72 characters is set.</li>
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">The Measure Open-Rate</span> is able to track how many HTML mailings were actually opened and read, a so-called "tracking pixel" is inserted into the E-Mail. You can choose between the tracking pixel pasted on the top of the mailing and on the bottom of the mailing</li> 
		<li><span class="menuepunkt">Template:</span> A mailing may be linked to a template. You do not need to jump to the Templates tab in order to view the contents of a template.</li>
