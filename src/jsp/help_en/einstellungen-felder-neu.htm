   <div class="head1">Settings - New profile field</div>
   <p>OpenEMM does not restrict entries in any way, because each user's profile database has different needs as far as applications and records are concerned. Profiles may be extended by an unlimited number of fields. Various data types are available. Dates, for instance a date of birth, are stored in a different way from, say, a town or street name.  Changes made to the structure of the database will always apply to all recipients stored in your database.  You should therefore decide in good time which fields you will require.  It is not a problem to add fields to the profile database at any time. After you made your changes, click on the save-button to save the settings. If you want to get back without any changing, click on the cancel-button. The entry fields have the following meaning:</p>
   <ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Field name:</span> The name of the field, which appears in the options menu, for example in target group definitions.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Description:</span> This entry defines the usage of the field. This helps if different user are working with OpenEMM.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Fieldname in DB:</span> This name only appears at the field management. This field specifies the name which will be saved in the profile database. Your entry will be changed in capital letters, separators have to be made by using the underline key (_). For Example '''CAR'_'USAGE'</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Type:</span> A field can include different kinds of data. There are the following field types available:
      <ul>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Date:</span> Fields of this type save a date.</li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Numerical:</span> This field type allows the entry of numbers. But you also may define if the user is interested (1) or if he is not (0). By using an action It is also possible to count up a numerical field (for example +1 with every reaction of the user).</li>
         <li><span class="menuepunkt">Alphanumerical:</span> There are no restrictions for your entry by choosing this field type. Use this type only, if you really want the user to enter all possible entries. </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Length:</span> This field defines the maximum number of characters which may be entered in this field. This only regards to alphanumerical fields. Number fields have a limit of 22 characters. An alphanumerical type should always be limited in his number of characters.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Default value:</span>This entry field defines which value is used from the beginning. In numerical fields it is recommended to use a default value of '0'. Alphanumerical fields can also be defined by a default value of 'none', for example if this is the default value of 'latest vacation destination'. Date needs no default value.</li>
   </ul>
   <p><b>Please note: </b>If you created a field, you are just able to change the fieldname and description. All other parameters can't be changed anymore. </p>
