   <div class="head1">Templates - New Template</div>
   <p>Templates are not tied to a mailing list or a specific mailing. They are available to all mailings. This is why the navigation bar features a templates area which you can call up to manage all your templates. It is now possible to display and amend the contents of a template directly from the detailed view of a mailing.  By using copy&paste, you may select a copy of an existing template, use this to create a new template and then make any amendments required. This saves a lot of time and a lot of typing effort. You also may use the included HTML-Editor in the separate browser window after your click on the HTML-editor-button. By clicking on save, the HTML-Code of your Template will be entered in the entryfield automatically.</p>
   <ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Name:</span> In this field you may enter a meaningful name for your template. This name will later be shown in overview lists and drop-down lists used for selecting templates.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Description:</span> The text should consist of one or two sentences. A shortened version of the description will later appear in the overview and the template's detailed view.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Mailing list:</span> Choose which mailing list will be used with this template.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Campaign:</span> Choose which campaign will be used with this template.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Mailing type:</span> You can choose between normal mailings, date- and actionbased mailings.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Targetgroups:</span> Shows the specified targetgroup(s). Default value is 'All recipients'.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Adding:</span> If you would like to link different targetgroup with each other, select the required target groups from the drop-down list and click on Add. If more than two individual target groups are involved, all recipients must be found in ANY one of the target groups (logical operator OR). You delete a particular targetgroup by clicking on the delete-button.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Subject::</span> The Subject field takes the reference that will appear in the recipient's E-Mail heading. Please note: It is possible to create individual subject headings using AGNITAS tags. </li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Sender E-Mail</span> is the E-Mail-address displayed in the "from"-field of the recipient. You should use an address, which does really exist. The recipients often trust in real names like tom.stanfee@company.com. </li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Absender-Name: / Reply-To E-Mail:</span> is the address to be used for replies. You should therefore use a meaningful address, such as newsroom@yourcompany.com, which does in fact exist.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Sender name: </span>  It is possible to assign different names to the sender's real-name address (sender Full Name) and the reply-to address (Reply-to Full Name), differentiated by the name displayed.  The different names may be entered into the template into the Sender Full Name and Reply-to Full Name respectively. If you enter only one name, e.g. into the Sender Full Name field, it will be used as the Reply-to Full Name.  </li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Charset:</span> The Charset drop-down list sets the character encoding within the E-Mail. The default value ISO 8859-1 is suitable for all Western European languages.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Line feed after:</span>The drop-down list Line feed after is provided as an option for the Text version of your mailing. Unlike HTML mailings, where line breaks are performed automatically, these have to be specified directly for text mailings. The default setting is a line break after 72 characters; you need not change this.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">The Format:</span> this drop-down list selects the mail format. Text, Text and HTML and Text, HTML and Offline-HTML are the possible options. In Text format, all E-Mail-clients are able to open this mailing, but formatinstructions (bold, Hyperlinks, Fontsize ...) will not be included. In HTML format, images and specific formatting may be added to the mailing. By using images from external AGNITAS-servers, your client may get problems with some browserinterfaces using for example a GMX-mailaccount. In OfflineHTML format, images are actually integrated into the E-Mail as a attachment, while in the normal HTML version images are downloaded from the server once the E-Mail is opened. </li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Measure Open-Rate: </span>  In order to be able to track how many HTML mailings were actually opened, a so-called "tracking pixel" is inserted into the E-Mail. Whenever the newsletter is opened, the server loads the pixel and thereby registers a click.<br>
      You select whether page clicks should be counted and how.  The tracking pixel will then be integrated automatically, either at the beginning or at the end of the E-Mail message according to your selection. Insert at the beginning: The server registers a click as soon as the E-Mail is opened.  Even when the recipient closes or deletes the message immediately after having opened it and before all images were completely downloaded, a click would have been registered.  Insert at the end: The server registers a click as soon as the E-Mail including all images was completely downloaded. This is the conservative method. It returns slightly lower figures than a click track at the beginning of the E-Mail.<br>
      It is also possible to insert a tracking pixel by hand using AGNITAS tags (which are explained in the appendix to this manual). </li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Text-Version:</span>In this entryfield you fill in the text-version of the template. Even if you choose the HTML-format for the delivery, you have to fill in a text. This text will be displayed, if the recipient can't open the HTML-Version.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">HTML-Version:</span> In this entryfield you fill in the HTML-version of the template.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Copy:</span> All template settings were copied and are absolutely identical. The words Copy of have been added to the template name, and the description field is empty. Now give your new template a meaningful name and description and click on the Save button. </li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Save:</span>The template can easily be saved by clicking on the save-button. </li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Delete:</span> By clicking on the delete-button, the template will be deleted from the system</li>
   </ul>
