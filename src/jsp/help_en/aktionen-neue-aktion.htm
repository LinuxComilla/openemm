   <div class="head1">Action - New Action</div>
   <p>An action is used to define what to do when a recipient clicks on a link. It could, for instance, cause a change in the recipient's user profile by incrementing the value in a Number field by 1. An action could also cause a mailing to be sent. Actions can combine several steps. In this chapter, we will deal with changing user profiles and sending out a mailing separately to keep things clear. In the navigation bar, click on the Actions button. Click on the New Action sub-menu in the navigation bar. The OpenEMM will display an entry dialog in the contents frame. </p>
   <ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Name:</span> In the Name box, select an appropriate name for the action. This name will be displayed each time you are prompted by the OpenEMM to select an action. To simplify your work, the name should be meaningful.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Description: </span>In this box, you can give a description of the intended aim of the action. This makes sense particularly if several people work with the OpenEMM. </li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Usage: </span> The drop-down list is used to determine how the action should be used. If you define an action as being for "links only", you are making sure that the action in question will only appear in drop-down lists where the subject matter is link-related.  This reduces the number of entries in drop-down lists.  The selection "only for forms" means that this particular action will only appear in drop-down lists on forms pages.  Selecting "Links and forms" specifies that the action is always available.  </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Next, you select what the action should do in a first step. The Type drop-down list offers you the following choice: Modify profile, Send mailing, Subscribe, Double opt-in confirmation, Load profile data and Unsubscribe. This chapter is concerned with profiles. You should therefore choose the Modify profile setting. To conclude your entries, click on the add button. Now you define exactly which field in the user profile should be changed by the system and how. The Column name drop-down list contains all fields in the user profile, both internal and user-defined.</p>
   <ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Modify profile:</span> A profile modification edits the recipients profile data. In the column name drop-down list, select the profile changes as you wish.
      <ul>
      	<li><span class="menuepunkt">Operator: </span> In the next drop-down list, select the "+" sign as the operator. Enter 1 as a value into the last box. This causes the value in the interest_travel field to be incremented by 1 each time the link is clicked. Now click on Save to close the field. You may insert numbers and Text.</li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Send action-based mailing: </span> This step launches the delivery of a previously set mailing to the recipient who already clicked on a link or who send a form (deepens on your "usage" settings)
      <ul>
      	<li><span class="menuepunkt">MAILING:</span> Set the Type drop-down list to Send action based mailing. Clicking on the save button sends your entries to the system. The drop-down list displays all action-based mailing lists which you have defined in ‘Mailings – New mailing' so far. Select the relevant mailing. The drop-down list does not feature either normal mailings, mailings which are not marked as "Delivery" or date-based mailings.</li>
      	<li><span class="menuepunkt">DELAY:</span> The Delay drop-down list sets the time lapse between starting the action and sending the E-Mail. There are various options, from one hour to seven days. A delay makes sense, for instance, if you offer the recipient an individual offer. Any normal person would expect this to take several hours at least. </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Subscribe:</span> This step edits the information from the recipient list out from a mailing list.
      <ul>
      	<li><span class="menuepunkt">Double opt-in:</span>  The Double opt-in parameter helps prevent faulty, mistaken or even malicious registration.  OpenEMM will send off a confirmation E-Mail to the subscriber after registration. It contains a link which the subscriber must click for confirmation. The system will not save the data in the database unless this link is clicked. Only after successful confirmation will the subscriber receive messages from the mailing list he or she subscribed to. If the subscriber does not react to the confirmation E-Mail, the profile is blocked and deleted from OpenEMM automatically after three months.<br>
      	Double opt-in is set as default. "Key-Column for Duplicate-Check and Updates" includes E-Mail as the default setting to detect the double opt-in. The "Use double-opt-in" option should be chosen, if the user shall be integrated into the mailing list by Double opt-in.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Load Profile data:</span> After clicking a measurable link or after delivering a form the profile data of the receiver will be loaded into a form. This helps, for example, to let the recipient change the E-Mail type from text to HTML by himself.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Unsubscribe:</span> The recipient will be deleted from a mailing list if he clicks on a measurable link or delivers a form. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>By clicking on "Save" you save the finished action. By clicking "Delete" and accepting the query the action will be deleted from the system.</p>
