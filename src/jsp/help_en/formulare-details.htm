   <div class="head1">Forms - Details</div>
   <p>From the customer's point of view, customer-oriented marketing is characterised by courteous treatment. This starts with the subscription to the newsletter. OpenEMM offers you a customised service that responds immediately to the opting in or opting out instructions of customers and prospects, and allows them to change their profile data. 
   Forms offer a very flexible customer interface in OpenEMM. Customers may register by themselves, subscribe to a mailing list, or change their personal profile data - like for instance the required mail format - directly on the website.</p>
   <ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Name:</span> defines the forms name. This name appears later on in OpenEMM, where you can choose a form.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Description:</span> Gives you the opportunity to add descriptive comments to the form. </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Formdefinition: <br>
   The forms concept follows a clear structure.  A form definition always consists of a starting action, a success form, an error form and a concluding action. Do not confuse forms and web forms. Within an OpenEMM form, HTML tags define web forms. For this reason, they are called HTML forms in this manual.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>The starting action prepares the OpenEMM for returning the success form to follow as a next step. The corresponding action is defined in the Actions section. The action may for instance be configured to fetch database entries for the user from the profile database after a change. </li>
      <li>The user will see the success form once the starting action was completed successfully. The form is a web page which the user sees in his or her browser. Its contents are specified using HTML tags and script commands.</li>
      <li>If the starting action cannot be completed successfully - for instance, because that user is not in the database at all - the user will see the error form in the browser window. For configuration of an error form, there are mainly the same possibilities as for creating a success form; however, a customised form is usually not possible because this would mean the recipient would have to feature in the database in the first place.  After returning the error form, processing is finished. The concluding action will not be carried out.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>The concluding action will only be carried out by OpenEMM if the starting action was completed successfully and the user sends off the success form.  In other words, this action is carried out after processing was completed.</p>
