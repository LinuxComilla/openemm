   <div class="head1">Forms - New Form</div>
   <p>This window gives you the opportunity to create a new form. Forms offer a very flexible customer interface in OpenEMM. Customers may register by themselves, subscribe to a mailing list, or change their personal profile data - like for instance the required mail format - directly on the website. Note: you have to be skilled in HTML coding to create and manage forms.</p>
   <ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Name:</span> defines the forms name. This name appears later on in OpenEMM, where you can choose a form.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Description:</span> Gives you the opportunity to add descriptive comments to the form.</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Preparations for the forms are now complete. Now go to the Forms section and select the New form sub-menu. Start by creating a form which will be used to display stored user profile data. A form definition always consists of a starting action, a success form, an error form and a concluding action.</p>
   <ul>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Action:</span> In the Action drop-down list underneath the Description box, select what OpenEMM should do before calling up the success form. All previously defined actions for that section are displayed in the drop-down list. Please note: Only actions where you defined, under Usage, that they should be used only for forms or Link and form are visible. For our example, select the Load user data action you defined in the previous section as your action.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Success:</span> In the Success form box, enter text or HTML code for the website where user profile data should be displayed. A further example for displaying Last name, First name, E-Mail address and Mailing list status is explained below.</li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Error:</span> The Error form box takes the text the system should return in case of an error. Here, all HTML commands are available as before. For the purpose of our example, however, the text An error has occurred should be enough. </li>
      <li><span class="menuepunkt">Action:</span> The concluding action will only be carried out by OpenEMM if the starting action was completed successfully and the user sends off the success form. In other words, this action is carried out after processing was completed. You first have to choose a category.</li>
   </ul>
